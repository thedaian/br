<h4>Success</h4>
Congratulations.  You have created a new user with the name {NAME}, and can return to the <a href="{URL}index.php">home page</a> and log in there.  Once again, remember your password ({PASSWORD}), as no one can tell you what it is if you lose it.  Since you are a new user, you will not be able to make a game of your own for a while.  Participate in other people's game first, to get an idea of how they're run.  Thank you for joining.
