<h4>About Page</h4>
Battle Royale is a wonderful book by Koushun Takami.  It was later turned into a movie, directed by Kinji Fukasaku, and spawned a sequal, and a series of Graphic Novels (aka, Manga).  It's about a group of students who're stuck on an island, and the only way to get off the island is to kill everyone else.  Really, though, if you haven't at least heard of Battle Royale, then I have no clue why you're here.<br/><br/>
With that said, this site is a vain attempt to reproduce some of the elements that made the book and movie incredible.  Even more so, it's designed to allow anyone to run a game, as opposed to a play by mail type of setting.  Currently, the site is in early beta testing, and additional features will be added upon requests, as well as bug fixes.  Everything here, though, should work as needed.<br/><br/>
So, how might one run a game of BR?  Well, first you have to be elevated to the status of 'power user' (I need a better name for that).  This is to prevent 500 people from running games, and no one actually playing those games.  Currently, the only way to get upgraded is to show that you deserve to run such a game.  In truth, though, as long as you have good spelling and grammar, you're probably fine.  You will have to contact me in game or by email to achieve such a status, though.<br/><br/>
